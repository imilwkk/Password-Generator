This program generates a random password based on user preferences for length and character types (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special symbols). It also categorizes the password strength based on its length.
How it works:
The program prompts for the password length and asks whether to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special symbols.
Based on the user's choices, it combines the relevant character sets
Random characters are selected from the available pool to create the password

The password strength is displayed as "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong" based on its length.
